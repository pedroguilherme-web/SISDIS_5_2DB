# US117 - View Total Maintenance Hours for the Fleet

## User Story

> As an ATCC, I want to view the total maintenance hours for the fleet so that I can understand the overall maintenance effort.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system returns a single `ViewTotalMaintenanceHoursinFleetResponse` payload.
- The total is calculated from the sum of all maintenance record expected durations.
- The endpoint always returns HTTP 200.

## Pre-conditions

- The actor is authenticated as an ATCC or Admin.

## Post-conditions

- No state change occurs; the use case is read-only.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The actor sends `GET /api/maintenance/records/hours`.
2. The system loads all maintenance records.
3. The system sums the expected duration of every record.
4. The system returns HTTP 200 with the total hours DTO.

## Alternative / Exception Flows

| Step | Condition                    | System Response                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2    | No maintenance records exist | HTTP 200 with total hours equal to 0 |

## Design Justification

- The current implementation uses an in-memory stream sum over `expectedDuration`, which matches the code and keeps the endpoint simple.
- The response is a dedicated DTO with a single `totalHours` field.
