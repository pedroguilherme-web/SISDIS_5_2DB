# US116 - View All Maintenance Records for Aircraft

## User Story

> As a Maintenance Technician, I want to view the maintenance records of a specific aircraft so that I can review its maintenance history.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The path includes the aircraft registration number.
- The aircraft must exist; otherwise HTTP 404 is returned.
- The result is paginated.
- The response is a page of `ViewAllMaintenanceRecordsResponse` DTOs.

## Pre-conditions

- The actor is authenticated as a Maintenance Technician or Admin.
- The target aircraft exists.

## Post-conditions

- No state change occurs; the use case is read-only.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The actor sends `GET /api/maintenance/records/aircraft/{registrationNumber}`.
2. The system validates that the aircraft exists.
3. The system loads the aircraft's maintenance records using pagination.
4. The system returns HTTP 200 with the paged DTO list.

## Alternative / Exception Flows

| Step | Condition                   | System Response             |
| ---- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 2    | Aircraft not found          | HTTP 404                    |
| 3    | The aircraft has no records | HTTP 200 with an empty page |

## Design Justification

- The use case returns a `Page<ViewAllMaintenanceRecordsResponse>` so the controller can expose a paginated read model.
- Aircraft existence is verified before querying records, which gives a clean 404 instead of an empty page for invalid registrations.
