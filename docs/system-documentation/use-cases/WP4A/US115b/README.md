# US115b - Create Maintenance Templates

## User Story

> As a Maintenance Technician, I want to create maintenance templates so that recurring maintenance work can be reused across compatible aircraft models.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The request must provide `name`, `templateType`, `applicableModels`, `checklist`, `intervalFlightHours`, and `intervalDays`.
- `applicableModels` is a list of aircraft model names, not IDs.
- Each model name must exist in the aircraft model catalog.
- Template names must be unique.
- On success the system returns HTTP 201 with the persisted `MaintenanceTemplate` representation.

## Pre-conditions

- The actor is authenticated as a Maintenance Technician.
- All referenced aircraft model names exist.

## Post-conditions

- A new `MaintenanceTemplate` entity is persisted with its applicable models and checklist.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The actor sends `POST /api/maintenance/templates` with the template payload.
2. The system resolves each model name to an `AircraftModel` entity.
3. The system checks whether a template with the same name already exists.
4. The system saves the template and returns HTTP 201.

## Alternative / Exception Flows

| Step | Condition                             | System Response |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 2    | One of the model names does not exist | HTTP 404        |
| 3    | Template name already exists          | HTTP 409        |

## Design Justification

- The use case keeps the request model simple by accepting model names and resolving them at the application layer.
- Intervals are stored on the template, which matches the current code and the maintenance clarification rules.
- The current controller returns the persisted domain entity, so the documentation reflects the API as implemented.
