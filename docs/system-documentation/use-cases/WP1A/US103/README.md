# US103 - View Aircraft Details

## User Story

> As an ATCC user or Backoffice Operator, I want to view the details of an aircraft by registration number.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The request path contains the aircraft registration number.
- The system returns the complete `ViewAircraftDetailsResponse` payload, including the version used for optimistic locking.
- If the aircraft does not exist, the system returns HTTP 404.
- On success the system returns HTTP 200 with HATEOAS links.

## Pre-conditions

- The actor is authenticated as an ATCC user or Backoffice Operator.

## Post-conditions

- No state change occurs; the use case is read-only.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The actor sends `GET /api/aircrafts/{registration}`.
2. The system loads the aircraft by registration number.
3. The system maps the aggregate to `ViewAircraftDetailsResponse`.
4. The system returns HTTP 200 with the DTO and links.

## Alternative / Exception Flows

| Step | Condition          | System Response |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 2    | Aircraft not found | HTTP 404        |

## Design Justification

- The controller uses the `RegistrationNumber` value object at the boundary, so the format validation stays in the domain layer.
- The response includes status and version so clients can safely perform later updates with optimistic locking.
